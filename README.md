This repository is me coding along with the excellent and highly informative talks of Tsoding, the playlist for which is located at [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VZPZKggcql-MmjaBdZKeDMw](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VZPZKggcql-MmjaBdZKeDMw).

The purpose of this repository is to build the framework for machine learning and neural networks from the ground up in C with (ideally) only the use of the standard library. In doing so, I hope to understand the fundamentals of Machine Learning on a deeper level than simply using a wrapper library for Python, for example.

For my personal ease this was coded on my Windows machine, but almost all code should be compilable on any operating system with access to the standard library.
